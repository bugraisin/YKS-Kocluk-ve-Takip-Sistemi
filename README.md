The YKS Koçluk ve Takip Sistemi project is driven by a dedicated team focused on addressing the pressing needs of students preparing for the Higher Education Institutions Exam (YKS). Recognizing the challenges students face in managing their study schedules, tracking progress, and receiving timely feedback from coaches, our team has defined the core problem as the lack of structured support for effective exam preparation. This project aims to develop a centralized platform that enhances the interaction between students and coaches, enabling efficient tracking of study materials, practice exams, and personalized feedback.
 To manage our project efficiently, we created a GitHub repository, which serves as the central hub for version control and documentation. The repository includes initial project descriptions, setup instructions, and a roadmap outlining key milestones. This structure will help us ensure transparency, collaboration, and easy access to all project resources as we move forward.
